# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project is a visualizer for various sorting algorithms implemented in C++ using the Raylib library. It allows you to see the sorting process in real-time, helping you understand and compare different sorting techniques.

Features:

Supported Sorting Algorithms: 
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort

Visual Representation: The data elements are represented as bars on the screen, with color changes indicating comparisons, swaps, and sorted positions.

Interactive Controls: 
Select the desired sorting algorithm from a menu.
Adjust the size of the data array to visualize larger or smaller datasets.
Generate different initial data distributions (e.g., random, pre-sorted, reverse-sorted) for testing purposes.
Optionally, display additional information like number of comparisons and swaps during the sorting process.
